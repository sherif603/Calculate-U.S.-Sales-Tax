# Calculate-U.S.-Sales-Tax
# Calculate the U.S. sales tax Project
# Sales taxes in the United States are taxes placed on the sale or lease of goods and services in the United States.
# Sales tax is governed at the state level and no national general sales tax exists.

# Software I used and own on my machine:
# Python3 (version python 3.8.3),
# Anacoda (version conda 4.8.4).
# Spyder (version 4.1.4).

# The source files: Calculate_Sales_tax.txt
# The output file: Calculate_Sales_tax.py

# Depending on where an individual is from I tax them by the applicable tax rate, appropriately.
# Sales tax is calculated by multiplying the purchase price by the corresponding state tax rate.
# The following U.S. sales tax rates in this project are related to the year 2018.
# However, it becomes out of date as soon as the state or local tax authorities make changes to tax laws and rules.
